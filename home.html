<h1>HTML Programming and Coding</h1>

<p>This is my home page.</p>

 My name is Duncan Van Hyning, I was born in Long Beach, California in Septmber 29, 1999. Long after I was three years old I've watch Spongbob Squarepance, Fairly odd parent, and lot of Nicktoons too many for mean to count. The Nicktoons were like brothers and sisters in arm to me because I imagine figting along side aganist criminals, warlords, and alsorts of evil villains. You can't think poissibilities of story telling I think of every day, I just came up with a jungle adventure of me and the nicktoons saving a ancient culture from a homiocidal warlord who wants their treasure. I can't imagie my life without those cartoon charaters it would be so sad and meaningless.
	So that is why I finally found a career that fits my love for cartoons. As soon I graduate from collage I'm going to become a animator. Animation is a large portion of creaivity and creativity is a talent in me. During my vist to New Vista I tooken an art class on drawing. I draw so many pictures of the Great Wall of China and Spongebob just not very straight. I just need to more advance class of computer drawing and coding. I hope you will enjow my frst show on tropical adventure.
